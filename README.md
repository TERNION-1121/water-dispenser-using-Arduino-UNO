# Automatic Water Dispenser using Arduino UNO
This repository consists of the details for an **Automatic Water And Soap Dispenser Project**.

## Working
The working is based on a simple mechanism:
1. The Water Dispenser would have an **Ultrasonic Sensor** installed.
2. As soon as the Ultrasonic sensor would detect hand movement under its range, it would turn the Water Pumo on, enabling the water to fall.
3. It would dispense water until movement under the Ultrasonic Sensor would be detected, otherwise it'd stop after a 1 second delay.

Same would be the working for the soap dispenser, with another Ultrasonic Sensor installed.
Here The soap would be dispensed in intervals, spaced by a second.
